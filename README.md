This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project is part of my plan to expand my knowledge with frontend, so this small but comprehensive application manages the creation of snippets, doing a CRUD in sqlite locally.

In this application we used the following technologies:

- NextJS
- Sqlite
- TypeScript
- Static Routes
- Dynamic Routes
- Cache control

The source code was made based in Udemy Course: Next JS: The Complete Developer's Guide (https://www.udemy.com/course/next-js-the-complete-developers-guide/)
